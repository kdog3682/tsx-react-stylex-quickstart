This template provides a minimal setup 
for working in Typescript React with StyleX.

command: `pnpm run dev` to start the local server.

The simplified directory structure is:

```
src
    components
        StyleXExample.tsx

    tokens.stylex.ts
    App.tsx

```

Perform edits on `StyleXExample.tsx` and see them take place live.

Everything should be working smoothly!
